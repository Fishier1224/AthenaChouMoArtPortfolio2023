I aim to investigate the central theme of “exploring language, expression, and space through means of computing”. 

In today’s globalized world, the specificity and complexity of language seem to be weakening: from the disappearance of dialects, through the replacement of native languages, to the abbreviation of languages. The same is valid from the perspective of computer science: a transformation from the fundamental C language to the increasingly convenient, user-friendly, and lower-threshold Python. 

We are constantly refining our expressions, but is this accompanied by questioning, confusion, and uncertainty about our self-worth? This fear of language and words is, in a sense, similar to people’s fear of technology. If an emoji or an acronym can represent emotions, where do one’s value and the value of one’s thinking come from? If a line of code or a machine simplifies (or even completes) one’s work, where does the value of our thinking come from? 

But suppose one were to think more carefully about the relationship between humans, machines, language, and space. In that case, a “nesting doll” phenomenon would occur: humans are the creators of computers as well as their language. On the one hand, as machines, computers do not directly understand the programming language typed by humans, but to interact with us, the computer’s language is forced to abstract. On the other hand, as human beings, we wish to express ideas that are abstracted by designated social standards and the so-called social etiquette. Language is abstract but particularly important: it constructs the logical basis of our expressions, turns our thoughts into exchangeable ideas, and represents our unique personality and “identity” as influenced by society.
